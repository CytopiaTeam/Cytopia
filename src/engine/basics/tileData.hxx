  * count is the number of images that are in the tile set. This is for things that 
  * will have a random tile chosen from their set. 
  *
  * offset is where the first image in this tileset is, so a file could contain multiple
  * tilesets and offset would define where to start this tileset and count would define
  * how many images it has. offset = 0 is the first image, offset = 3 is the 4th tile. 
  *
  * rotations is the number of rotations that exist in this tileset (for buildings). 
  * this is not applicable for terrain and roads, their orientation is figured out
  * differently. For buildings that have multiple orientations, this isn't implemented
  * yet but it prevents buildings with multiple orientations from being placed with 
  * a random image (that might be the wrong size).
