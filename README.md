Cytopia is a free, open source retro pixel-art city building game with a big focus on mods. Itâ€™s based on a custom isometric rendering engine based on SDL2.

Visit our Projects website at <https://www.cytopia.net>
Or our community page for Dev Blogs and our forum <https://community.cytopia.net>

Current Key Features:
- Custom UI System, based on JSON. Highly moddable
- SDL2 based rendering engine written in C++
- Camera panning, zooming, relocating
- Terrain manipulation
- Pixel-art graphics made by Kingtut 101 and Pineapples Trix
- A Qt based tile editor for editing TileData JSON files.

Planned features:
- Procedural Terrain Generation
- OpenGL Renderer
- Gameplay mechanics
- In-Game Mod downloading mechanism
- Android / iOS / Mac Support
- Scripting language for mods (like LUA)

#### Key Features
- Different zoom levels
- Relocate camera via rightclick
- Read settings from json files ( Filename to tile ID  / Engine specific Settings )
- Terrain editing (raise / lower terrain)

#### Supported Platforms
Linux (clang / g++-5 or higher)
Windows

#### Prerequisites

CMake 3.11 or later

<https://cmake.org/>


Conan

<https://conan.io>


#### Build instructions

Some of our resources are stored in a git submodule. We recommend to add the `--recursive` parameter during git clone or init
To build the TileData editor, you will need a qt installation for your build environment.

For already cloned repositories, use to get the submodules.
`git submodule update --init --recursive`

This project uses [CMake](https://cmake.org) to manage the build.
Please make sure you have installed at least version 3.9 or later.
To build the project, create a new build directory, then:

    cmake <PATH_TO_REPOSITORY>

*Note:* If you're on windows, you might want to specify a generator for Visual Studio, like:

    cmake -G "Visual Studio 15 2017 Win64"<PATH_TO_REPOSITORY>

This will configure the build.

*Note:* If you want to change your install directory (per default it's set to ../install) add the definition `-DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/foo/bar` to your cmake call.

**Build Instructions:**
Once the build is configured, you can then compile it using:

    cmake --build .

To install the project,

    cmake --build . --target install

Create a package (MSI, RPM, DEB, DMG, ZIP)

    cmake --build . --target package

#### Coding guidelines

Please use the clang-format (.clang-format file is provided in the root of the repository), if you want to contribute in order to format your code according to our coding guidelines.

If you are on a linux system, you can use:

    find . -regex '.*\.\(hxx\|cxx\)' -not -path '*/ThirdParty/*' -exec clang-format -style=file -i {} \;
