# Find SDL2
# ---------
#
# Finds the SDL2 library. This module defines:
#
#  SDL2_FOUND               - True if SDL2 library is found
#  SDL2::SDL2               - SDL2 imported target
#
# Additionally these variables are defined for internal usage:
#
#  SDL2_LIBRARY             - SDL2 library
#  SDL2_INCLUDE_DIR         - Root include dir
#
